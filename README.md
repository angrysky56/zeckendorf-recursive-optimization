# Zeckendorf-Recursive Optimization Algorithms

A research project implementing practical optimization algorithms based on the mathematical foundations of Zeckendorf representation, Fibonacci constraints, and golden ratio principles from:

[zt.dw.cash/traditional-math/hilbert-complete/08-zeckendorf-hilbert-theory](https://zt.dw.cash/traditional-math/hilbert-complete/08-zeckendorf-hilbert-theory/index.html)

## Mathematical Foundation

This project explores the practical application of **Zeckendorf-Hilbert theory** mathematical concepts:

- **Zeckendorf Representation**: Every positive integer uniquely expressed as sum of non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers
- **No-11 Constraint**: Natural bounds preventing consecutive Fibonacci terms
- **Golden Ratio Optimization**: φ-based step sizes and convergence rates
- **Recursive Hilbert Spaces**: Fibonacci-structured search spaces

## Theoretical Motivation

Unlike speculative applications to consciousness or literary analysis, these mathematical concepts have:
- **Established foundations** in number theory and optimization
- **Proven efficiency** in existing algorithms (Fibonacci heaps, golden section search)
- **Testable hypotheses** with clear success metrics
- **Practical applications** in machine learning and complex systems
